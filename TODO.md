- Is there some way to for mkJanetPackage to refer to the revision of the git repo its running in?
- Support janet programs with no dependencies.
- Figure out if we should be doing something better with the libGL dependencies.
- Maybe move url to withJanetPackages so that I can use different versions of the same package for different dependencies.
